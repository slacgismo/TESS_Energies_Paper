	abstract = {This paper discusses integration of plug-in electric vehicles in smart grids from different perspectives. First, in order to achieve a grid-friendly charging load profile, a strategy is proposed based on the transactive control paradigm. This charging strategy enables electric vehicle owners to participate in real-time pricing electricity markets to reduce their charging costs. Second, the impact of large-scale adoption of electric vehicles on electricity generation and inter-area flow schedules is discussed. In order to quantify potential changes, an interconnection-scale optimal scheduling problem should be solved to determine hourly tie-line flows. In the presence of price sensitive loads, the objective function of the scheduler is to maximize the total social welfare (i.e., economic surplus) rather than minimize production cost. Third, the utilization of demand response for frequency control purpose is studied. Fast-acting demand response eases the use of slow-ramping generation units, which is particularly important in the case of high penetration levels of intermittent renewable resources to maintain the realtime balance between supply and demand. The procedure described enables estimation the benefits of smart charging in terms of cost and GHG emissions reduction for different renewable portfolio policies.},

Recently, a novel proposal for the design and operation of electricity markets has emerged: these so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity markets conceptually allow the prosumers to directly share their electrical energy and investment. Such P2P markets rely on a consumer-centric and bottom-up perspective by giving the opportunity to consumers to freely choose the way they buy their electric energy. A community can also be formed by prosumers who want to collaborate, or in terms of operational energy management.

	abstract = {Demand response and dynamic pricing programs are expected to play increasing roles in the modern smart grid environment. While direct load control of end-use loads has existed for decades, price driven response programs are only beginning to be explored at the distribution level. These programs utilize a price signal as a means to control demand. Active markets allow customers to respond to fluctuations in wholesale electrical costs, but may not allow the utility to control demand. Transactive markets, utilizing distributed controllers and a centralized auction, can be used to create an interactive system which can limit demand at key times on a distribution system, decreasing congestion. With the current proliferation of computing and communication resources, the ability now exists to create transactive demand response programs at the residential level. With the combination of automated bidding and response strategies, coupled with education programs and customer response, emerging demand response programs have the ability to reduce utility demand and congestion in a more controlled manner. This paper will explore the effects of a residential double-auction market, utilizing transactive controllers, on the operation of an electric power distribution system.},

In the proposed model, aggregator offers an incentive to consumers to purchase power from and/or sell the excess power back to the grid. To do so, controller at the aggregator’s side determines optimal incentive which has to be offered to consumers by maximizing its own proﬁt. Then, local controller at the consumer’s location optimizes battery operation by calculating purchased/sold power from/to the grid based on the local demand, PV generation, retail time-of-use (ToU) prices and demand charge, and the incentive offered by the aggregator to maximize its own proﬁt. Different optimization problems are formulated in the two layers, and the proﬁt of aggregator and consumers in the day-ahead energy market under perfect and imperfect prediction scenarios are compared.},

The effects that such mechanisms could pose on the stability and efficiency of the entire system is investigated and several stability criteria are presented. It is shown that relaying the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers creates a closed loop feedback system which could be unstable or lack robustness, leading to extreme price volatility. Finally, a result is presented which characterizes the efficiency losses incurred when, in order to achieve stability, the wholesale prices are adjusted by a static pricing function before they are passed on to the retail consumers.},

This paper elaborates main focuses and outcomes of those projects, and compares their similarities and differences.

In most countries, however, ESS market share is small and whether or not the technology will attain a critical market share is subject to homeowners' investment decisions. For policy and industry alike, it is of particular interest to identify factors that drive ESS adoption. Empirically addressing this question, we hypothesized that the factors autarky and autonomy aspirations crucially determine ESS adoption decisions. In two studies (Ntotal = 489), sketching future decentralized energy scenarios, we found evidence for the importance of both factors for homeowners' evaluations of the technology. However, only autarky significantly affected homeowners' willingness to pay extra for ESS, in that homeowners invested more in the technology when autarky was higher (Study 1) or autarky benefits were emphasized (Study 2). In accordance with concepts aspiring to optimize energy flow on the low-voltage grid level (e.g. Smart Neighborhoods), we additionally examined the influence of autarky and autonomy aspirations on homeowners' willingness to exchange self-generated energy within a local energy network. Results showed that emphasis on autarky increased the subjective value of self-generated energy, decreasing the likelihood of peer-to-peer energy trading.},

abstract = {Power systems worldwide have gone through a transition from vertically integrated into liberalized energy markets. At the same time, increased environmental concerns are promoting the use of renewable and efficient generation technologies. Consequently, a growing number of small-scale Distributed Energy Resources (DER) are being installed in distribution systems. Passive operation of DER can result in severe grid operation problems. In contrast, active DER management can bring mutual benefits for the DER owner as well as Distribution System Operators (DSO). In this article a flexible multi-objective optimization scheme is presented in which DER placement and optimal ancillary services are evaluated and compared with conventional grid reinforcements. This allows assessing the potential of optimal active DER management and evaluating different tariff schemes for DER connection at different levels of DER in the grid. The proposed method uses a hybrid Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2) with a distribution Optimal Power Flow (OPF).

In order to reach consumers 'beyond the eco-niche', identifying the drivers that positively influence the adoption of green electricity is of fundamental importance. This paper examines various factors that help to explain the extent to which green electricity subscribers differ from those that display strong preferences towards green electricity but have not yet 'walked the talk'. By making use of a latent class segmentation analysis based on choice-based conjoint data, this paper identifies three groups of potential green electricity adopters with varying degrees of preference for renewable energy. Findings indicate that socio-demographic factors play a marginal role in explaining the differences between green electricity subscribers and potential adopters, with the exception that actual adopters tend to be better educated. Analysis of psychographic and behavioral features reveals that adopters tend to perceive consumer effectiveness to be higher, place more trust in science, tend to estimate lower prices for green electricity tariffs, are willing to pay significantly more for other eco-friendly products and are more likely to have recently changed their electricity contract than non-adopters. Policy recommendations associated with these findings are provided.},

abstract = {Generation from distributed renewable energy sources is constantly increasing. Due to its volatility, the integration of this non-controllable generation poses severe challenges to the current energy system. Thus, ensuring a reliable balance of energy generation and consumption becomes increasingly demanding. In our approach to tackle these challenges, we suggest that consumers and prosumers can trade self-produced energy in a peer-to-peer fashion on microgrid energy markets. Thus, consumers and prosumers can keep profits from energy trading within their community. This provides incentives for investments in renewable generation plants and for locally balancing supply and demand. Hence, both financial as well as socio-economic incentives for the integration and expansion of locally produced renewable energy are provided. The efficient operation of these microgrid energy markets requires innovative information systems for integrating the market participants in a user-friendly and comprehensive way. To this end, we present the concept of a blockchain-based microgrid energy market without the need for central intermediaries. We derive seven market components as a framework for building efficient microgrid energy markets. Then, we evaluate the Brooklyn Microgrid project as a case study of such a market according to the required components. We show that the Brooklyn Microgrid fully satisfies three and partially fulfills an additional three of the seven components. Furthermore, the case study demonstrates that blockchains are an eligible technology to operate decentralized microgrid energy markets. However, current regulation does not allow to run local peer-to-peer energy markets in most countries and, hence, the seventh component cannot be satisfied yet.},

abstract = {Optimization of network configuration involving the switch statuses is important for the operation in the distribution system. This paper presents a network configuration optimization approach based on the plant growth simulation algorithm (PGSA), which is specially suited to large-scale distribution systems. An elegant design method of the decision variables, which describes the radial feature of the distribution network and considerably reduces the dimension of the variables in the solved model, is developed. Moreover, a detailed description on switch states further improves the efficiency of calculation. The main advantage of the proposed approach in relation to previously published random algorithms is that it does not require any external parameters such as barrier factors, crossover rate, mutation rate, etc. These parameters are hard to be effectively determined in advance and affect the searching performance of the algorithm. The proposed approach is applied to a 33-bus sample system and a large-scale real system. The best solutions of the two systems, which were published in the technical literature, have been found in shorter time than the existing random algorithms. The numerical results demonstrate well the validity and effectiveness of the proposed approach. {\textcopyright} 2007 IEEE.},

Next, we assess the empirical evidence. This is in two forms-econometric evidence from samples of countries and case studies of reforms in particular jurisdictions. The econometric evidence is weak due to problems with simultaneity of reform steps and a lack of studies, but the case study evidence is compelling. We conclude with a discussion of the issues faced by countries considering implementing ownership unbundling. We conclude that evidence seems to be that ownership unbundling of transmission is a key part of energy market reform in the most successful reform jurisdictions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The paper proposes a framework for modeling and analysis of the dynamics of supply, demand, and clearing prices in power system with real-time retail pricing and information asymmetry. Real-time retail pricing is characterized by passing on the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers, and is shown to create a closed-loop feedback system between the physical layer and the market layer of the power system. In the absence of a carefully designed control law, such direct feedback between the two layers could increase volatility and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and generation. A new notion of generalized price-elasticity is introduced, and it is shown that price volatility can be characterized in terms of the system's maximal relative price elasticity, defined as the maximal ratio of the generalized price-elasticity of consumers to that of the producers. As this ratio increases, the system becomes more volatile, and eventually, unstable. As new demand response technologies and distributed storage increase the price-elasticity of demand, the architecture under examination is likely to lead to increased volatility and possibly instability. This highlights the need for assessing architecture systematically and in advance, in order to optimally strike the trade-offs between volatility, economic efficiency, and system reliability.},

This paper presents a distribution locational marginal pricing (DLMP) method through chance constrained mixed-integer programming (MIP) designed to alleviate the possible congestion in the future distribution network with high penetration of electric vehicles (EVs). In order to represent the stochastic characteristics of the EV driving patterns, a chance constrained optimization of the EV charging is proposed and formulated through MIP. With the chance constraints in the optimization formulations, it guarantees that the failure probability of the EV charging plan fulfilling the driving requirement is below the predetermined confidence parameter. The efficacy of the proposed approach was demonstrated by case studies using a 33-bus distribution system of the Bornholm power system and the Danish driving data. The case study results show that the DLMP method through chance constrained MIP can successfully alleviate the congestion in the distribution network due to the EV charging while keeping the failure probability of EV charging not meeting driving needs below the predefined confidence.},

The levelized cost of energy storage is the minimum price per kWh that a potential investor requires in order to break even over the entire lifetime of the storage facility. We forecast the dynamics of this cost metric in the context of lithium-ion batteries and demonstrate its usefulness in identifying an optimally sized battery charged by an incumbent solar PV system. Applying the model to residential solar customers in Germany, we find that behind-the-meter storage is economically viable because of the large difference between retail rates and current feed-in tariffs.

On the upside, unbundling in network industries promotes competition, but this should be balanced against the downside of unbundling, that is, the cost of coordination. Firm-internal coordination falls away and must be replaced by external market mechanisms. This is a non-trivial task. The cost of flawed coordination resulting from fragmentation can be substantial and policy should focus more on market mechanisms and governance structures to secure better coordination. This paper examines the problem of coordination and discusses with real-world examples why the market faces difficulty in providing effective coordination.},

@article{Bompard2013,
abstract = {In emerging electrical distribution systems, a multitude of self-interested individual decision makers interacts among themselves and with the power grid. The optimal operation of the grid, according to a set of predefined technical and economic targets, can be achieved by influencing the behaviors of the decision makers with appropriate market signals. The technical feasibility and performance of the system, for example, in terms of line flow limits, network losses, and appropriate voltage profile, can thus be controlled to a certain extent, by market signals. In this paper, we present a conceptual framework for 'Market-based Control' for the operation of emerging distribution systems. Characterized by distributed and adaptive control signals over prosumers, market-based control needs to make prosumer benefits aligned with regulator/DSOs concerns, thus satisfying the requirements from both sides. By applying market-based control in network charging, both network and market performances can be improved. The complexity in the environment and in the interactions among players prompt techniques to be derived from complex systems theory. A multiagent model was built up for testing the market control strategies strategy. The concept and applications are illustrated with reference to a standard CIGRE medium-voltage distribution network. {\textcopyright} 1986-2012 IEEE.},

@article{Fridgen2016,
abstract = {Increasingly, residential customers are deploying PV units to lower electricity bills and contribute to a more sustainable use of resources. This selective decentralization of power generation, however, creates significant challenges, because current transmission and distribution grids were designed for centralized power generation and unidirectional flows. Restructuring residential neighborhoods as residential microgrids might solve these problems to an extent, but energy retailers and system operators have yet to identify ways of fitting residential microgrids into the energy value chain. One promising way of doing so is the tailoring of residential microgrid tariffs, as this encourages grid-stabilizing behavior and fairly re-distributes the associated costs. We thus identify a set of twelve tariff candidates and estimate their probable effects on energy bills as well as load and generation profiles. Specifically, we model 100 residential microgrids and simulate how these microgrids might respond to each of the twelve tariffs. Our analyses reveal three important insights. Number one: volumetric tariffs would not only inflate electricity bills but also encourage sharp load and generation peaks, while failing to reliably allocate system costs. Number two: under tariffs with capacity charges, time-varying rates would have little impact on both electricity bills and load and generation peaks. Number three: tariffs that bill system and energy retailer costs via capacity and customer charges respectively would lower electricity bills, foster peak shaving, and facilitate stable cost allocation.},

One of the major and well-recognised benefits of DG is its ability to defer future demand-related investments, providing potentially significant savings and competitive advantage for regulated Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). In this paper an approach that considers the successive elimination method and multistage planning is proposed in order to quantify the investment deferral brought about by DG. Here, each required reinforcement and its implementation schedule affected by the connection of DG can be clearly identified by the DNO. A typical UK distribution network circuit is evaluated. Results show that characteristics of DG such as location, size, power factor and the commissioning time can result in significant reductions of the total planning costs. The investment deferral per MW of connected DG is also investigated as an index that could assist DNOs in evaluating the attractiveness of potential connection points as well as in quantifying the benefit produced by DG.},

abstract = {The energy transition from a formerly centralized, fossil-fuel based system towards a sustainable system based on a large share of renewable generation calls for a decentralization and regionalization of the electricity system. Local electricity markets (LEMs), on which prosumers and consumers can trade locally produced electricity, meet these requirements and simultaneously enable formerly excluded residential customers to actively take part in the electricity market. However, trading can be complex and time intensive. Therefore, it should be automated. We provide an analysis of intelligent learning strategies for agents of residential electricity customers in LEMs. To this end, we conduct a multi-agent-based simulation of a LEM with a merit order market design based on the current German electricity spot market. LEM agents maximize their individual utility via reinforcement learning. We expand existing approaches of reinforcement learning with generation and storage states as well as time-dependent learning. The evaluation of the strategies is based on the agents' and community electricity storage's revenues, costs, and consumption of local electricity. The results show that for fixed sell prices, time-dependent reinforcement learning of buy bids is the best strategy. It facilitates a market self-consumption of 54 {\%}. For learning buy and sell prices, traditional reinforcement learning with generation states is the dominant strategy.},

It allows bidders to express minimum and maximum amounts of flexibility along with unit prices in single bids for varying time periods. We perform a simulation-based evaluation and assess costs and benefits for DSOs and balancing suppliers given scenarios of varying complexity as well as computational aspects of the auction.

abstract = {This paper presents a mathematical model of con- sumer behavior in response to stochastically-varying electricity prices, and a characterization of price elasticity of consumption induced by optimally shifting flexible demands within a fixed time window. The approach is based on deriving the optimal load-shifting policy through a finite horizon stochastic dynamic program, and the analysis is performed under both perfect and partial information about price distribution. An aggregate demand model is constructed from individual demands with random arrivals and random deadlines. Under this model, the aggregate demand becomes a function of price only, and thus allows for quantitative characterization of the utility of demand and price elasticity. While the demand for electricity is often deemed to be highly inelastic, it is shown in this paper that optimal load-shifting can create a considerable amount of price elasticity, even when the aggregate consumption over a long period remains constant.},

@article{Vytelingum2008,
abstract = {In this paper, we describe a novel bidding strategy that autonomous trading agents can use to participate in Continuous Double Auctions (CDAs). Our strategy is based on both short and long-term learning that allows such agents to adapt their bidding behaviour to be efficient in a wide variety of environments. For the short-term learning, the agent updates the aggressiveness of its bidding behaviour (more aggressive means it will trade off profit to improve its chance of transacting, less aggressive that it targets more profitable transactions and is willing to trade off its chance of transacting to achieve them) based on market information observed after any bid or ask appears in the market. The long-term learning then determines how this aggressiveness factor influences an agent's choice of which bids or asks to submit in the market, and is based on market information observed after every transaction (successfully matched bid and ask). The principal motivation for the short-term learning is to enable the agent to immediately respond to market fluctuations, while for the long-term learning it is to adapt to broader trends in the way in which the market demand and supply changes over time. We benchmark our strategy against the current state of the art (ZIP and GDX) and show that it outperforms these benchmarks in both static and dynamic environments. This is true both when the population is homogeneous (where the increase in efficiency is up to 5.2{\%}) and heterogeneous (in which case there is a 0.85 probability of our strategy being adopted in a two-population evolutionary game theoretic analysis). {\textcopyright} 2008.},

@book{Faruqui2010,
abstract = {Since the energy crisis of 2000–2001 in the western United States, much attention has been given to boosting demand response in electricity markets. One of the best ways to let that happen is to pass through wholesale energy costs to retail customers. This can be accomplished by letting retail prices vary dynamically, either entirely or partly. For the overwhelming majority of customers, that requires a change out of themetering infrastructure, whichmay cost asmuch as {\$}40 billion for theUS as a whole. While a good portion of this investment can be covered by savings in distri- bution system costs, about 40{\%} may remain uncovered. This investment gap could be covered by reductions in power generation costs that could be brought about through demand response. Thus, state regulators inmany states are investigating whether cus- tomers will respond to the higher prices by lowering demand and if so, by how much. To help inform this assessment, this paper surveys the evidence from the 15most recent pilots, experiments and full-scale implementations of dynamic pricing of electricity. It finds conclusive evidence that households respond to higher prices by lowering usage. The magnitude of price response depends on several factors, such as the mag- nitude of the price increase, the presence of central air conditioning and the availability of enabling technologies such as two-way programmable communicating thermostats and always-on gateway systems that allowmultiple end-uses to be controlled remotely. In addition, the design of the studies, the tools used to analyze the data and the geog- raphy of the assessment influence demand response. Across the range of experiments studied, time-of-use rates induce a drop in peak demand that ranges between 3 and 6{\%} and critical-peak pricing (CPP) tariffs induce a drop in peak demand that ranges between 13 and 20{\%}.When accompanied with enabling technologies, the latter set of tariffs lead to a reduction in peak demand in the 27–44{\%} range.},

abstract = {Many electricity markets around the world treat electricity as a commodity - without qualitative distinctions. This view does not recognize the many different attributes and services that different generation technologies can provide. The Smart Grid platform will provide the technological conditions for even more service differentiation. In this paper, we discuss elements of an alternative view for organizing the markets in a Smart Grid scenario. The key element is the consideration of electricity as a multi-attribute product. The specification of these attributes will first require a clear understanding of the Social Planner's Problem (SPP), as defined in standard economics. Such understanding will facilitate the valuation of the resource attributes with respect to the fulfillment of societal objectives. The emphasis of the paper is investigating the SPP for resource allocation, getting resources appropriately sized in advance. The solution of this problem offers insight, and provides sensible guidelines for how many resources, and of which type, are required. Our viewpoints are illustrated via a detailed investigation of the system-wide value of operational flexibility, along with the market implications. A general discussion about the role of contracts to support multi-attribute products is also included.},

The idea of smart markets revolves around using theoretically supported computational tools to both understand the characteristics of complex trading environments and multiechelon markets and help human decision makers make real-time decisions in these complex environments. We outline the research opportunities for complex trading environments primarily from the perspective of design of computational tools to analyze individual market organization and provide decision support in these complex environments. In addition, we present broad research opportunities that computational platforms can provide, including implications for policy and regulatory research. {\textcopyright} 2010 INFORMS.},

We propose an approach to internalize the stochasticity of renewable distributed energy resources (DERs) and risk tolerance of the distribution system operator in DLMP computations. This is achieved by means of applying conic duality to a chance-constrained AC optimal power flow. We show that the resulting DLMPs consist of the terms that allow to itemize the prices for the active and reactive power production, balancing regulation, network power losses, and voltage support provided. Finally, we prove the proposed DLMP constitute a competitive equilibrium, which can be leveraged for designing a distribution electricity market, and show that imposing chance constraints on voltage limits distorts the equilibrium.},

abstract = {The vision of the Smart Grid includes the creation of intelligent electricity supply networks to allow efficient use of energy resources, reduce carbon emissions and are robust to failures. One of the key assumptions underlying this vision is that it will be possible to manage the trading of electricity between homes and micro-grids while coping with the inherent real-time dynamism in electricity demand and supply. The management of these trades needs to take into account the fact that most, if not all, of the actors in the system are self-interested and transmission line capacities are constrained. Against this background, we develop and evaluate a novel market-based mechanism and novel trading strategies for the Smart Grid. Our mechanism is based on the Continuous Double Auction (CDA) and automatically manages the congestion within the system by pricing the flow of electricity. We also introduce mechanisms to ensure the system can cope with unforeseen demand or increased supply capacity in real time. Finally, we develop new strategies that we show achieve high market efficiency (typically over 90{\%}).},

abstract = {Self-consumption is an increasingly economically attractive solution for electricity generated by distributed energy resources, which also reduces transmission losses, power line overload and grid instability. Yet, at single-building scale, production and demand do often not coincide. Microgrids are proposed as a means to trade surplus energy produced with local prosumers and consumers, to take advantage of complementary load profiles. Here we define a consumer as a single metered residential unit, a prosumer as a consumer with a photovoltaic system, which first uses the on-site energy generated prior to exporting the surplus, and the microgrid as a clearly defined number of both prosumers and consumers. In this article, we systematically analyze to what extent varying microgrid sizes and prosumer-consumer ratios affect local self-consumption and self-sufficiency rates. To that end, we developed a simulation model that uses real-world load profiles from 4190 residential buildings as input data. We find that the prosumer-to-consumer ratio is more important than the absolute microgrid size, for microgrids sizes greater than ten. The results also indicate that prosumer-to-consumer ratios in the range of 40{\%}-60{\%} have the best performance. Each simulation is also compared to the baseline scenario of a stand-alone prosumer, which shows significantly better self-consumption ratios and self-sufficiency ratios for microgrids due to aggregation effects. Finally, this work may also be used as a reference to design residential microgrid communities for various prosumer-consumer compositions and various production-to-demand ratios.},

abstract = {Blockchains or distributed ledgers are an emerging technology that has drawn considerable interest from energy supply firms, startups, technology developers, financial institutions, national governments and the academic community. Numerous sources coming from these backgrounds identify blockchains as having the potential to bring significant benefits and innovation. Blockchains promise transparent, tamper-proof and secure systems that can enable novel business solutions, especially when combined with smart contracts. This work provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental principles that underpin blockchain technologies, such as system architectures and distributed consensus algorithms. Next, we focus on blockchain solutions for the energy industry and inform the state-of-the-art by thoroughly reviewing the literature and current business cases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first academic, peer-reviewed works to provide a systematic review of blockchain activities and initiatives in the energy sector. Our study reviews 140 blockchain research projects and startups from which we construct a map of the potential and relevance of blockchains for energy applications. These initiatives were systematically classified into different groups according to the field of activity, implementation platform and consensus strategy used.1 Opportunities, potential challenges and limitations for a number of use cases are discussed, ranging from emerging peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading and Internet of Things (IoT) applications, to decentralised marketplaces, electric vehicle charging and e-mobility. For each of these use cases, our contribution is twofold: first, in identifying the technical challenges that blockchain technology can solve for that application as well as its potential drawbacks, and second in briefly presenting the research and industrial projects and startups that are currently applying blockchain technology to that area. The paper ends with a discussion of challenges and market barriers the technology needs to overcome to get past the hype phase, prove its commercial viability and finally be adopted in the mainstream.},

abstract = {The increasing number of distributed energy resources connected to power systems raises operational challenges for the network operator, such as introducing grid congestion and voltage deviations in the distribution network level, as well as increasing balancing needs at the whole system level. Control and coordination of a large number of distributed energy assets requires innovative approaches. Transactive control has received much attention due to its decentralized decision-making and transparent characteristics. This paper introduces the concept and main features of transactive control, followed by a literature review and demonstration projects that apply to transactive control. Cases are then presented to illustrate the transactive control framework. At the end, discussions and research directions are presented, for applying transactive control to operating power systems, characterized by a high penetration of distributed energy resources.},

abstract = {Retail real-time pricing (RTP) of electricity – retail pricing that changes hourly to reflect the changing supply/demand balance – is very appealing to economists because it “sends the right price signals.” Economic efficiency gains from RTP, however, are often confused with the short-term wealth transfers from producers to consumers that RTP can create. Abstracting from transfers, I focus on the long-run efficiency gains from adopting RTP in a competitive electricity market. Using simple simulations with realistic parameters, I demonstrate that the magnitude of efficiency gains from RTP is likely to be significant even if demand shows very little elasticity. I also show that “time-of-use” pricing, a simple peak and off-peak pricing system, is likely to capture a very small share of the efficiency gains that RTP offers.},

We introduce a local electricity market on which prosumers and consumers of a community are able to trade electricity directly amongst each other. This local electricity market supports the local integration of renewable energy generation. It facilitates a local balance of energy supply and demand and hence reduces the need for extensive electricity transmission. We introduce, evaluate and compare two local market designs, a direct peer-to-peer market and a closed order book market, as well as two agent behaviors, zero-intelligence agents and intelligently bidding agents. We derive four scenarios by combining each market design with each agent behavior, respectively. All market scenarios offer similar economic advantages for the market participants. However, the peer-to-peer market with intelligent agents appears to be the most advantageous as it results in the lowest average overall electricity price.},

abstract = {The smart grid paradigm implies flexible demand and energy storage in order to cope with the variability of renewable energy sources. Buildings are often put forward as a potential supplier of flexibility services through demand side management (DSM) and distributed energy storage, partly as thermal energy. This paper presents a bottom-up approach for the quantification of this flexibility service. Cost curves are computed from the solution of optimal control problems with low-order models. These curves show the amount of flexibility and their associated cost. The method is generic and can be applied to heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) services, thermal energy storage (TES) and local electricity production. A case study is performed on a monitored office building in Brussels, Belgium. The results reveal a large variation in both flexibility and cost depending on time, weather, utility rates, building use and comfort requirements. The study shows that for the studied day, flexibility is not for free. The mean flexibility cost has the same order of magnitude as the imbalance price in the Belgian power system.},

abstract = {Deployment of distributed generation technologies, especially solar photovoltaic, have turned regular consumers into active contributors to the local supply of electricity. This development along with the digitalisation of power distribution grids (smart grids) is setting the scene to a new paradigm: peer-to-peer electricity trading. The design of the features and rules on how to sell or buy electricity locally, however, is in its early stages for microgrids or small communities. Market design research focuses predominantly on established electricity markets and not so much on incentivising local trading. This is partially because concepts of local markets carry distinct features: the diversity and characteristics of distributed generation, the specific rules for local electricity prices, and the role of digitalisation tools to facilitate peer-to-peer trade (e.g. Blockchain). As different local or peer-to-peer energy trading schemes have emerged recently, this paper proposes two market designs centred on the role of electricity storage. That is, we focus on the following questions: What is the value of prosumer batteries in P2P trade?; What market features do battery system configurations need?; and What electricity market design will open the economical potential of end-user batteries? To address these questions, we implement an optimisation model to represent the peer-to-peer interactions in the presence of storage for a small community in London, United Kingdom. We investigate the contribution of batteries located at the customer level versus a central battery shared by the community. Results show that the combined features of trade and flexibility from storage produce savings of up to 31{\%} for the end-users. More than half of the savings comes from cooperation and trading in the community, while the rest is due to battery's flexibility in balancing supply-demand operations.},

@article{Roche2010,
abstract = {The electric grid is currently undergoing important changes: it is evolving from an entirely centralized structure to a decentralized one, mainly due to the massive development of distributed renewable energy sources. This evolution toward what we now call the smart grid requires new control methods. These methods must be able to withstand new requirements, such as the highly distributed nature of the grid, the ability to run in islanding mode, the intermittency of renewable energy sources and the limited bandwidth for communications. Multi-agent systems (MAS) have characteristics that meet these requirements. In contrary to classical analytical methods, the grid is considered as a collection of simple entities called agents corresponding to sources, loads and other components, evolving in a given environment. A certain degree of distributed or collective intelligence can be achieved through the interaction of these agents with each other, cooperating or competing to reach their goals. This article is a short review of several multi-agent systems published in the literature and used for grid energy management. It presents a number of concepts and experiments used by researchers to apply this promising method. Various approaches and their results are compared, in order to give the reader a global perspective of the state of the art in this precise domain. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

The concern seems to be that a customer could find itself consuming a large quantity of power on the day that prices skyrocket, resulting in a high monthly bill. I analyze the magnitude of this risk, using demand data from 1142 large industrial customers, and then ask how much of this risk can be eliminated through various straightforward financial instruments. I find that very simple hedging strategies - forward purchase contracts that are already used with many RTP programs - can eliminate more than 80{\%} of the bill volatility that would otherwise occur. I then show that a slightly more sophisticated application of these forward power purchases can significantly enhance their effect on reducing bill volatility.

This paper exploits hourly household electricity consumption data collected by "smart" electricity meters to examine dynamic consumer behavior under intermittent expenditure signals. Households reduce consumption by 0.6-1{\%} following receipt of an electricity bill, but the response varies considerably by household type and season. Our results also suggest that spending "reminders" can reduce peak demand, particularly during summer months.

However, it is unclear how such peer-to-peer (P2P) markets should be designed to create value for the user. In a framed field experiment, we design and implement Switzerland's first real-world P2P electricity market in a local community. We examine its value proposition for the users and elicit user preferences by enabling the participants to directly influence buy and sell prices for local solar energy. The collected empirical evidence suggests that the P2P exchange is beneficial for users and provides incentives for generation of renewable energy.

abstract = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) energy markets are a widely discussed approach toward a sustainable energy supply that allows private owners of distributed energy resources (e.g., solar panels) and consuming households to trade energy directly without intermediaries. P2P energy markets are expected to contribute to a green, local, and fair energy system in the future. The approach implies a paradigm shift regarding the role of citizens who evolve from passive consumers into active market participants. While first existing research primarily focused on the technical feasibility of such scenarios, end users and their role in P2P markets have received little attention. The present article studies the behavior of 35 households and two commercial entities in Switzerland's first real-world P2P energy market. In this unique real-world setting, based on a mixed methods approach, we developed and deployed a web application and empirically studied interaction, acceptance, and participation in electricity pricing in this P2P energy market, using data from system logs, surveys, and interviews. The findings are threefold. First, the P2P energy market was well received among its users, indicated by comparably high and stable usage activity of the web application throughout the study (4.5 months). Second, users in the sample are heterogeneous; based on their engagement with the web application and their stated preferences, they can be categorized into those who want to actively set prices (30{\%}); those who prefer automated prices determined by an information system (35{\%}); and non-users/non-respondents to surveys (35{\%}). Third, an analysis of interviews with nine households suggests that P2P energy markets may increase the salience of renewable energies and may promote load-shifting activities. Thus, the article provides empirical insights about the user behavior of households and their future role in decentralized energy scenarios.},

abstract = {This paper proposes bilateral contract networks as a new scalable market design for peer-to-peer energy trading. Coordinating small-scale distributed energy resources to shape overall demand could offer significant value to power systems, by alleviating the need for investments in upstream generation and transmission infrastructure, increasing network efficiency and increasing energy security. However, incentivising coordination between the owners of large-scale and small-scale energy resources at different levels of the power system remains an unsolved challenge. This paper introduces real-time and forward markets, consisting of energy contracts offered between generators with fuel-based sources, suppliers acting as intermediaries and consumers with inflexible loads, time-coupled flexible loads and/or renewable sources. For each type of agent, utility-maximising preferences for real-time contracts and forward contracts are derived. It is shown that these preferences satisfy full substitutability conditions essential for establishing the existence of a stable outcome-an agreed network of contracts specifying energy trades and prices, which agents do not wish to mutually deviate from. Important characteristics of energy trading are incorporated, including upstream-downstream energy balance and forward market uncertainty. Full substitutability ensures a distributed price-adjustment process can be used, which only requires local agent decisions and agent-to-agent communication between trading partners.},
